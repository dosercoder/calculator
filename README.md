# calculator
A little project to demonstrate HTML/CSS/JS and logic.

Starting off with basic input fields for:
1) first value
2) operator
3) second value
4) submit buttom

I have created basic function to calculate these two values. Embed via onclick attribute to button in html.

Next steps:
- I want values to be input additionally via buttons (as well as keyboard) to resemble a realistic calculator. Probably by individual onclick functions but I feel there must be a more efficient way.
- Develop a 'clear' button.
- Ability to do more complex calculations by using result of first calculation as first value to a new calculation. This should include distinction between whether result remains on screen or everything has been 'cleared'.
- Make the calculator more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use.
